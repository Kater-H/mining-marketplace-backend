# Complete AWS Setup Guide for Windows Beginners
## Mining Marketplace Backend Deployment

### üéØ Overview
This guide will take you from zero to having your Mining Marketplace backend running on AWS. We'll do everything step by step, and I'll explain what each step does.

**What we're building:**
- A professional backend API running on Amazon Web Services
- A PostgreSQL database to store your data
- A public URL that stakeholders can access
- Monitoring and logging for production use

**Estimated time:** 45-60 minutes

---

## STEP 1: Create Your AWS Account (10 minutes)

### 1.1 Sign Up for AWS
1. **Go to AWS website**: Open your browser and visit https://aws.amazon.com
2. **Click "Create an AWS Account"** (orange button in top right)
3. **Enter your information:**
   - Email address (use a professional email if possible)
   - Password (make it strong!)
   - AWS account name (e.g., "YourName-MiningMarketplace")

### 1.2 Verify Your Identity
1. **Phone verification**: AWS will call or text you with a verification code
2. **Enter the code** when prompted
3. **Choose support plan**: Select "Basic support - Free" (this is fine for now)

### 1.3 Add Payment Method
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: AWS requires a credit card, but we'll set up billing alerts so you won't get surprised charges.

1. **Add your credit card information**
2. **Verify your card** (AWS may charge $1 temporarily to verify)

### 1.4 Set Up Billing Alerts (IMPORTANT!)
1. **Go to AWS Console**: After account creation, you'll be in the AWS Management Console
2. **Click your name** in the top right corner
3. **Select "Billing and Cost Management"**
4. **Click "Billing preferences"** in the left sidebar
5. **Check the box** for "Receive Billing Alerts"
6. **Click "Save preferences"**

Now let's create an alert:
1. **Go to CloudWatch** (search for it in the AWS search bar)
2. **Click "Alarms"** in the left sidebar
3. **Click "Create alarm"**
4. **Select "Billing"** as the metric
5. **Set threshold to $10** (this will alert you if costs exceed $10)
6. **Enter your email** for notifications
7. **Click "Create alarm"**

‚úÖ **You now have an AWS account with cost protection!**

## STEP 2: Install Required Tools (15 minutes)

### 2.1 Install AWS CLI
The AWS CLI lets us control AWS from the command line.

1. **Download AWS CLI**: Go to https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
2. **Run the installer**: Double-click the downloaded file
3. **Follow the installation wizard**: Keep clicking "Next" with default settings
4. **Restart Git Bash**: Close and reopen Git Bash

**Test the installation:**
```bash
aws --version
```
You should see something like: `aws-cli/2.x.x Python/3.x.x Windows/10`

### 2.2 Install Docker Desktop
Docker lets us package our application into containers.

1. **Download Docker Desktop**: Go to https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. **Click "Download for Windows"**
3. **Run the installer**: Double-click the downloaded file
4. **Follow the installation wizard**:
   - ‚úÖ Check "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V"
   - ‚úÖ Check "Add shortcut to desktop"
5. **Restart your computer** when prompted

**After restart:**
1. **Start Docker Desktop**: Double-click the desktop icon
2. **Accept the license agreement**
3. **Wait for Docker to start** (you'll see a whale icon in your system tray)

**Test Docker in Git Bash:**
```bash
docker --version
```
You should see something like: `Docker version 20.x.x`

‚úÖ **You now have all the required tools installed!**

---

## STEP 3: Set Up AWS Security (15 minutes)

### 3.1 Create an IAM User
Instead of using your main AWS account, we'll create a special user for deployments.

1. **Go to AWS Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com
2. **Search for "IAM"** in the search bar and click it
3. **Click "Users"** in the left sidebar
4. **Click "Create user"**

**User details:**
- **User name**: `mining-marketplace-deployer`
- **Select "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console"**: ‚ùå Leave unchecked
- **Click "Next"**

### 3.2 Set Permissions
1. **Select "Attach policies directly"**
2. **Search and select these policies** (check the box next to each):
   - `AmazonECS_FullAccess`
   - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`
   - `AmazonRDS_FullAccess`
   - `CloudFormationFullAccess`
   - `IAMFullAccess`
   - `AmazonVPCFullAccess`
   - `ElasticLoadBalancingFullAccess`

3. **Click "Next"**
4. **Review and click "Create user"**

### 3.3 Create Access Keys
1. **Click on your new user** (`mining-marketplace-deployer`)
2. **Click the "Security credentials" tab**
3. **Scroll down to "Access keys"**
4. **Click "Create access key"**
5. **Select "Command Line Interface (CLI)"**
6. **Check the confirmation box**
7. **Click "Next"**
8. **Add description**: "Mining Marketplace Deployment"
9. **Click "Create access key"**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Copy both the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key somewhere safe. You'll need them in the next step!

‚úÖ **You now have secure AWS credentials!**

---

## STEP 4: Configure AWS CLI (5 minutes)

Now we'll connect your computer to your AWS account.

1. **Open Git Bash**
2. **Run the configuration command:**
```bash
aws configure
```

3. **Enter your information when prompted:**
   - **AWS Access Key ID**: Paste the Access Key ID from Step 3.3
   - **AWS Secret Access Key**: Paste the Secret Access Key from Step 3.3
   - **Default region name**: Type `us-east-1`
   - **Default output format**: Type `json`

**Test your configuration:**
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see something like:
```json
{
    "UserId": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mining-marketplace-deployer"
}
```

‚úÖ **Your computer is now connected to AWS!**

## STEP 5: Deploy Your Application (10 minutes)

Now for the exciting part - let's deploy your Mining Marketplace backend!

### 5.1 Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd /path/to/your/mining-marketplace/backend
```

### 5.2 Run the Deployment Script
```bash
./deploy-aws.sh
```

**What this script does:**
1. ‚úÖ Checks that everything is set up correctly
2. ‚úÖ Creates all the AWS infrastructure (VPC, database, load balancer, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Builds your application into a Docker container
4. ‚úÖ Uploads the container to AWS
5. ‚úÖ Starts your application on AWS servers
6. ‚úÖ Sets up monitoring and health checks

**Expected output:**
```
[2024-01-20 10:30:15] Starting AWS deployment for Mining Marketplace Backend
[2024-01-20 10:30:16] Checking prerequisites...
[SUCCESS] Prerequisites check completed
[2024-01-20 10:30:17] Deploying infrastructure with CloudFormation...
```

**This will take about 10-15 minutes.** The script will show you progress updates.

### 5.3 Deployment Complete!
When finished, you'll see:
```
[SUCCESS] Deployment completed successfully!
Application URL: http://mining-marketplace-production-alb-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
Health Check: http://mining-marketplace-production-alb-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health
```

‚úÖ **Your application is now live on the internet!**

---

## STEP 6: Test Your Deployment (5 minutes)

### 6.1 Test the Health Check
Copy the Health Check URL from the deployment output and paste it into your browser.

You should see something like:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T15:30:45.123Z",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 6.2 Test the API
Try accessing your API endpoints:
- `http://your-url/api/users` - User management
- `http://your-url/api/marketplace` - Marketplace features
- `http://your-url/api/payment` - Payment processing

‚úÖ **Your Mining Marketplace backend is now running on AWS!**
