This document presents a detailed, actionable plan for implementing Integration & API Testing that builds upon our robust unit test foundation. The plan addresses critical user journeys, external service integrations, and production-like scenarios to ensure the Mining Marketplace platform operates seamlessly in real-world environments.

## 1. Current Architecture Analysis and Integration Testing Priorities

### 1.1 Backend Architecture Overview

The Mining Marketplace backend follows a well-structured layered architecture with clear separation of concerns. The current implementation includes four primary API route groups that form the foundation for integration testing:

**User Management Routes** (`/api/users`) provide comprehensive user lifecycle management including registration, email verification, authentication, and profile management. These routes integrate with the authentication middleware, user services, and database models to deliver secure user management capabilities.

**Marketplace Routes** (`/api/marketplace`) handle the core business functionality including mineral listing creation, retrieval, updates, and photo management. These routes implement role-based authorization and integrate with marketplace services and models to provide the primary value proposition of the platform.

**Payment Routes** (`/api/payments`) manage financial transactions through dual payment gateway integration with Stripe for global markets and Flutterwave for African markets. These routes handle payment creation, transaction tracking, and webhook processing for real-time payment status updates.

**Health Routes** (`/api/health`) provide system monitoring and health check capabilities essential for production deployment and operational monitoring.

### 1.2 Critical Integration Points

The backend architecture presents several critical integration points that require comprehensive testing to ensure seamless operation. The authentication and authorization flow represents the most fundamental integration point, where the authentication middleware must correctly validate JWT tokens, extract user information, and enforce role-based access controls across all protected endpoints.

Database transaction integrity forms another crucial integration point, particularly for complex operations that span multiple tables such as user registration with profile creation, mineral listing creation with photo uploads, and payment processing with transaction recording. These operations must maintain ACID properties and handle rollback scenarios gracefully.

External service integration with Stripe and Flutterwave payment gateways introduces network-dependent functionality that requires careful testing of both success and failure scenarios. The webhook processing capabilities must handle asynchronous payment status updates reliably and maintain data consistency.

The middleware chain integration ensures that requests flow correctly through CORS handling, authentication, authorization, and error handling middleware components. Each middleware component must function correctly in isolation and as part of the complete request processing pipeline.

### 1.3 Priority User Journeys for Integration Testing

Based on the business-critical nature of operations and user experience impact, the following user journeys have been identified as highest priority for integration testing:

**Complete User Registration and Authentication Flow** represents the entry point for all users and must function flawlessly. This journey includes user registration with email validation, email verification through token-based confirmation, user login with JWT token generation, and authenticated access to protected resources. The integration testing must validate that all components work together seamlessly, including email service integration, database persistence, and token management.

**End-to-End Mineral Listing Management** encompasses the core marketplace functionality that enables sellers to create, manage, and showcase their mineral offerings. This journey includes authenticated listing creation with photo uploads, listing retrieval with filtering and pagination, listing updates with authorization validation, and listing deletion with proper cleanup. The integration testing must ensure that all marketplace operations maintain data integrity and enforce proper authorization controls.

**Complete Payment Processing Workflow** represents the most complex integration scenario, involving multiple external services and critical financial operations. This journey includes payment intent creation through either Stripe or Flutterwave, payment confirmation and processing, webhook handling for status updates, transaction recording and status management, and error handling for payment failures. The integration testing must validate that financial operations are secure, reliable, and maintain transactional integrity.

**User Profile and Session Management** ensures that authenticated users can manage their accounts and maintain secure sessions across multiple requests. This journey includes profile retrieval and updates, session validation and renewal, role-based access control enforcement, and secure logout functionality.




## 2. Integration Testing Strategy and Framework Design

### 2.1 Testing Philosophy and Approach

The integration testing strategy for the Mining Marketplace backend adopts a comprehensive approach that validates both internal component interactions and external service integrations. Unlike unit tests that isolate individual components, integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly in realistic scenarios that mirror production usage patterns.

The testing philosophy emphasizes real-world scenario validation, where tests simulate actual user interactions and business workflows rather than isolated technical operations. This approach ensures that the system behaves correctly under conditions that users will actually experience, including network latency, database load, and external service dependencies.

The framework design prioritizes test isolation and repeatability, ensuring that each test can run independently without affecting other tests or requiring specific execution order. This isolation is achieved through comprehensive test data management, database state reset mechanisms, and careful handling of external service interactions.

Performance and reliability validation forms a core component of the integration testing strategy. Tests must validate not only functional correctness but also performance characteristics such as response times, throughput, and resource utilization under realistic load conditions.

### 2.2 Testing Scope and Boundaries
